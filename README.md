My project is used to track whether a triangle is Equilateral,Isosceles,Scalene or not a triangle.This is done by a user is prompted to input three lengths.If all the sides are equal the triangle is an equilateral triangle.If exactly two sides are equal it is an isosceles triangle.If none of the sides are equal the triangle is a scalene triangle.However if the sum of two sides should be greater than one side.If the sum of any two sides is equal to or less than the third remaining side then it is not a triangle. One may access triangle tracker using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. A link to a live site on github would be https://neema2018.github.io/triangle-tracker/
